## What is this?
### What Is Cards Against Humanity?
The [game][cards-against-humanity], with its [game rules][game-rules] was invented by a Kickstarter campaign in the year 2011.
It is a turn based card game for the most parts played in real life.

Every player receives a specific amount of white cards that are used to fill placeholders provided in the black card.

At the end of the round, when all players played a card, the card czar (in our case the `CardJizzer`) picks the most hilarious card.

On the start of a new round every player gets the amount of whitecards he laid in the last round.

Although there are already clones out there we want to build a open source forgery for the App- and PlayStore. 

We decided to bring fresh air in this game and created this hybrid app which allows anybody to play
this beautiful game anywhere and anytime.

### What is this repo about?
This repository is the wrapper of the backend.

Please follow [this][frontend] link for the frontend part of this project.

## Motivation
Why are we doing this? We want the future of games to be more transparent and modifiable for any developer.
